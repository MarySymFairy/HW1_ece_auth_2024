# HW1: Verilog Simulation Project

### Overview

This project was developed as part of the HW1 assignment for the Electrical and Computer Engineering course in the 7th semester. The goal of this project is to design, implement, and simulate a digital system using Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL). The simulation and testing of the Verilog code were carried out using Icarus Verilog and Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the development environment.


### Project Structure

The project directory contains the following key files and directories:
- "Εργασία" contains the subject of the project, (in Greek).
- "HW" file contains my code files, divided as the report said. It also contains my work report(in Greek).


### Requirements

1. Icarus Verilog: A Verilog simulation and synthesis tool.
2. Visual Studio Code (VS Code): A source-code editor for writing and editing Verilog code.
3. GTKWave (optional): A waveform viewer for analyzing the simulation output.
